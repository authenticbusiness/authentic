                <br><br>My work is known for its clarity.
                <br><br>
                My font designs are used large format in public spaces and privately by diverse individuals. To function well in all these different contexts, they have to embody a certain universality and timelessness.
                <br><br>
                The clean and crisp lines that characterise my font designs give them a very modern feeling. However, they come from a deep interest in and knowledge of the past, and the formal and technical approaches in Chinese calligraphy, which our ancestors used to bring clarity to everyday visual life and communication.

                <strong>Furniture Typology | Key Features | Materials</strong>
                <br><br>
                As my work revolves around fonts and, as a consequence, words, I would like to collaborate on a piece of furniture at which one can write - in whatever manner one chooses, whether that’s by hand or using a keyboard.
                <br><br>
                I don’t want to be overly prescriptive in my requirements. My fonts are used by millions of people to create their own work. In the same way, I want to leave it to you to dictate the form and materials for this piece.
                <br><br>
                What I do ask is that the piece respects and reflects my own preference for clean lines and visual clarity.</li>

            <li><strong>2015:</strong> Jasper Morrison publishes "A Book of Things."<br><br>I had tried several times to design drinking glasses and found it to be one of the most difficult projects. Then one day, I found some antique stem glasses in a junk shop in Paris. After using them for a few years, I understood how perfectly unpretentious they were and what great atmosphere they gave to the table. They provided me with the starting point for the wine glass designed to complement the porcelain tableware we were developing at that time. As the originals were hand-blown, each of them had a slightly different shape, so I spent some time working out which was the best of them and then recreated the line as a computer drawing. I modified it very slightly to give it exactly the character I wanted. Then I enlarged the foot, which seemed to balance the bowl better, and the molds were made from that finished outline. The new glass was slightly different, yet related to the old ones, lacking their variety of shapes but having a certain strength of character to substitute for the lost charm. The other glasses followed easily, adapting a very normal type of straight-sided, tapered tumbler by adding a slight curve to their profiles.
