            Writer Kurt Vonnegut draws a line across a blackboardâ€”the x-axis. The left side of the line marks the beginning of a story; the right side of the line marks the end. He calls this the B-E axis, beginning and entropy. He draws a vertical line on the blackboard, the y-axis. Higher values on the y-axis represent good fortune, while lower values represent ill fortune. He calls this the G-I axis. Archetypal stories are plotted on this graph, with sinusoidal lines representing the challenges and successes of the protagonists in Cinderella, Kafka, and Shakespeare.

            At a dried lakebed, an artist demonstrates an idea. A group of artists, architects, designers, writers, dancers, and researchers are gathered to watch this performance. The artist places a stone on the ground and says this represents the beginning of a story. The artist walks away from the stone for about a minute, places another stone on the ground, and says this represents the end of the story. The artist invites the group watching to gather around the beginning stone. The group is instructed to walk, discuss, and think with each other as they make their way over to the ending stone. When everyone in the group has arrived at the ending stone, the artist removes the beginning stone, explaining that the ending stone now represents both the beginning and the end of the story. The group is invited to walk, discuss, and think with each other around the beginning stone, wander away from the beginning, and then find their way back to the same stone, now also representing the end of the story. When everyone in the group returns to the ending stone, the artist announces that the stone now only represents the beginning of the story, and there is no stone or other object representing the end. The group is asked to walk, discuss, and think with each other around the beginning stone.
