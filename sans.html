	<p>A typeface intended for situations where Oriya Sangam MN seems too sophisticated and LiHei Pro too vulgar, or vice versa. AUTHENTIC Sans explores the semiotic and aesthetic idiosyncrasies of the anonymous Latin glyphs included with CJK system fonts; the typeface aims to subvert the Eurocentric standards of typographic quality and refinement. Distributed freely under the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/" target="_blank">WTFPL</a>, AUTHENTIC Sans is a reflection of the studio praxis: expanding and redefining the visual and cultural boundaries of default systems. The typeface was first used on the booth poster for <a href="https://co-ed.us/" target="_blank">Cooperative Editions</a> and <a href="http://www.commonsatisfactorystandard.com/" target="_blank">Common Satisfactory Standard</a> at the 2015 NY Art Book Fair.</p>

	<h2>Our Mission &amp; Vision</h2>
	<p>In 1984 Eastern AmericaTrio Products was created as a way to connect products to people. Peopleconsistently have basic needs that they need fulfilled. People constantly hadto find ways to buy these products and sometimes the products would be either tooexpensive or not of great quality. That is why the two founders decided tostart a wholesale distribution company that dealt with 99 cent stores, dollarstores, variety stores and discount stores of all types. With the belief thatquality products could be created at affordable prices we hope to share ourproducts with as many people as possible.</p>

	<h2>The Sayings &amp;Culture</h2>
	<p>When you buy a productor go into a store what is your purpose for going into the store? Typically wehave noticed much too often that people go into a store to just buy some tool,headset or party accessories and we thought that is good that people can do	that but the product can be more than just a product. Have you ever noticedthe philosophical sayings on a Trisonic, Powtech, or Sonitek package? If youhave how did it make you feel? Over the years we have received mixed commentsabout these quotes. The reasoning behind these quotes are that our company isnot just a company that creates products we also believe in how, as a company,we are part of the community and that the products are part of our daily lives.</p>

	<h2>The Customers &amp;Products</h2>
